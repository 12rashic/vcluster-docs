Most resources inside your virtual cluster only exist in your virtual cluster and not in the host cluster.


To verify this, perform these steps:

<Flow>
   <Step>
      Disconnect from the current virtual cluster and switch back to the host context.

      ```bash
      vcluster disconnect
      ```
   </Step>
   <Step>
      Check namespaces in the host cluster.

      ```bash
      kubectl get namespaces
      ```
      Output is similar to:
      ```bash
      NAME                 STATUS   AGE
      default              Active   35m
      kube-public          Active   35m
      kube-system          Active   35m
      # highlight-next-line
      team-x               Active   30m
      ```
   </Step>
   <Step>
      Look for the `nginx-deployment` deployment.

      ```bash
      kubectl get deployments -n team-x
      ```

      Notice that this resource does NOT exist in the host cluster because it normally does not get synced from the virtual to the host cluster since its typically not required to run workloads on the host cluster.

   </Step>
   <Step>
      Now, look for the NGINX pods.

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods -n team-x
      ```

      Output is similar to:

      ```bash
      coredns-cb5ccc67f-kqwmx-x-kube-system-x-my-vcluster            1/1     Running   0          34m
      my-vcluster-0                                                  1/1     Running   0          34m
      nginx-deployment-6d6565499c-cbv4w-x-demo-nginx-x-my-vcluster   1/1     Running   0          20m
      nginx-deployment-6d6565499c-s7g8z-x-demo-nginx-x-my-vcluster   1/1     Running   0          20m
      ```

      You can see from the output that the the two NGINX pods exist in the host cluster. The vCluster `my-cluster-0` pod is the vCluster control plane.

   </Step>
</Flow>

:::info K8s Resource Renaming
To prevent collisions, the pod names and their namespaces are rewritten by vCluster during the sync process from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.
