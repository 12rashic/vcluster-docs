vCluster is able to use different Kubernetes distributions as a virtual cluster distribution. 

:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the Kubernetes distribution of vCluster is not supported.
:::

By default, the distribution of vCluster is vanilla Kubernetes and is the recommended distribution to use. 

There are 2 other options of distributions for vCluster. 

* [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.
* [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. Please note that dual stack networking is not supported with k0s, you will be able to deploy it on a dual stack host cluster, but it will not have all the dual stack features.
