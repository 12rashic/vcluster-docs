By default, `vCluster` runs one instance of each of its components. That’s fine for many use cases, like ones that are very ephemeral (dev environments, CI/CD, etc.).
Suppose your situation requires `vCluster` instances with more redundancy. In that case, you can use the High Availability (HA) feature
to run multiple copies of the `vCluster` components so that the cluster is more resistant to partial failures.

## Create the HA virtual cluster

To create a `vCluster` instance using the `vCluster` CLI, we run the `vcluster create` command. To enable HA, we’ll need to specify the distro and the `vcluster.yaml` file to use:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  # Use an external etcd for vCluster
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        statefulSet:
          highAvailability:
            replicas: 3
  # Deploy vCluster with 3 replicas
  statefulSet:
    highAvailability:
      replicas: 3
```

```
vcluster create ha-tutorial --connect=false -f vcluster.yaml
```

We’ve named the virtual cluster `ha-tutorial`. By default, the `vcluster create` command connects to the `vCluster` instance,
but for the purposes of this tutorial, we’ve disabled that with the `--connect=false` flag.

You should see output like this:
```
info   Creating namespace vcluster-ha-tutorial
...
- Use 'vcluster connect ha-tutorial --namespace vcluster-ha-tutorial' to access the vCluster instance
```
:::note
Some of your output may differ depending on whether you use a local or remote cluster.
:::

As you can see, `vcluster` has created a `namespace` called `vcluster-ha-tutorial`. The `vCluster` instance lives inside that `namespace` on the host cluster. Next, let’s see what `pods` are running in that `namespace`.

```
kubectl get pods -n vcluster-ha-tutorial
```
```
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ha-tutorial-7c5c5844c5-27j2v              0/1     Running   0          20s
ha-tutorial-7c5c5844c5-gb2sm              0/1     Running   0          20s
ha-tutorial-7c5c5844c5-pwn7k              0/1     Running   0          20s
ha-tutorial-etcd-0                        0/1     Running   0          20s
ha-tutorial-etcd-1                        0/1     Running   0          20s
ha-tutorial-etcd-2                        0/1     Running   0          20s
```
There are now three replicas of each component of the `vCluster` instance running. If one API server `pod` were down, the `vCluster` instance would continue functioning.

If you’d like more information about how the `pods` were scheduled in the `vCluster` instance, add the `-o wide` flag to that previous command.

```
kubectl get pods -n vcluster-ha-tutorial -o wide
```
The hostnames of the `nodes` will be listed in the NODES column.

# Connect to the vCluster instance

We can connect to the `vCluster` instance using the `vcluster connect` command.

```
vcluster connect ha-tutorial
```
```
info   Starting proxy container...
done √ Switched active kube context to vcluster_ha-tutorial_vcluster-ha-tutorial_minikube
- Use `vcluster disconnect` to return to your previous kube context
- Use `kubectl get namespaces` to access the vcluster
```
`vcluster connect` automatically switches our kube context for `kubectl` to the `vCluster` instance. Now we can see the `namespaces` inside of the `vCluster` instance by running this command:
```
kubectl get namespaces
Copy
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   31s
kube-node-lease   Active   33s
kube-public       Active   33s
kube-system       Active   33s
```
Our `vCluster` instance only contains the default `namespaces` that were created by Kubernetes.

Now let’s disconnect from the `vCluster` instance.

```
vcluster disconnect
```
This will switch your kube context back to the host cluster.

# Cleanup

One of the great things about `vcluster` is that it’s very fast and easy to clean up the `vCluster` instances when you’re done using them.

```
vcluster delete ha-tutorial
```
That will delete the `vCluster` instance and the `namespace` it was in.
