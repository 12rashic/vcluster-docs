[k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

In order to use k3s as backing cluster, create a vCluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --set controlPlane.distro.k3s.enabled=true
```

Start using it:

```
kubectl get ns
...
```

For more configuration options, please take a look at the [k8s distro reference](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/distro/k3s)
