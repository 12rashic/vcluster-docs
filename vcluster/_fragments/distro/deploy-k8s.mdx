In order to use vanilla k8s as a backing cluster, create a vCluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster
```

Connect to the vCluster and start using it:

```
kubectl get ns
...
```

For more configuration options, please take a look at the [k8s distro reference](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/distro/k8s)
