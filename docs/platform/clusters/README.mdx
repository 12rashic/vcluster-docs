## What are clusters?

A cluster is a Kubernetes cluster that can be connected to and managed from the vCluster.Pro UI. This can be a local Kubernetes cluster where vCluster.Pro is installed in or an external cluster which is deployed on a cloud provider for instance.

When connecting a cluster to vCluster.Pro, vCluster.Pro tries to install the vCluster.Pro agent on the cluster which is used to orchestrate all further interactions with the cluster.

Once connected, you can create virtual clusters and spaces in the selected cluster.
