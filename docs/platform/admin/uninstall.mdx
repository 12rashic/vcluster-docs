## Delete Helm Release

```bash
helm delete -n vcluster-pro loft
```

Please make sure you also uninstall kiosk, if you have connected the loft cluster:

```bash
helm delete -n vcluster-pro loft-agent
```

## Delete Namespace (optional)

```bash
kubectl delete ns vcluster-pro
```

If you have deleted the namespace **without** deleting the vcluster-pro and loft-agent helm releases beforehand, please make sure the api-services and webhooks are deleted correctly:

```bash
# vCluster.Pro agent api service and webhook
kubectl delete apiservice v1.cluster.loft.sh
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration loft-agent
```

## Delete CRDs (optional)

```bash
kubectl api-resources --api-group='storage.loft.sh' -o name | xargs kubectl delete crd
```

Delete kiosk resources (such as accounts, templates, templateinstances):

```bash
kubectl api-resources --api-group='config.kiosk.sh' -o name | xargs kubectl delete crd
```

:::warning Data Loss
Deleting the vCluster.Pro CRDs will also remove all vCluster.Pro objects inside your cluster, e.g. `Cluster`, `Team`, and `User`. This **cannot** be undone.
