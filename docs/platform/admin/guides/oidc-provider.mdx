title: Using vCluster.Pro as OIDC Provider
sidebar_label: vCluster.Pro as OIDC Provider
---

vCluster.Pro can act as an OpenID Connect provider for other services, e.g. a self-hosted container registry using [Harbor](https://goharbor.io).

To tell vCluster.Pro to act as OIDC provider, navigate to `Admin > Config` and add the `oidc` section to your config:

```yaml {2-9}
auth: ...
oidc:
  enabled: true
  clients:
    - name: "Example Client"
      clientId: "loft"
      clientSecret: "MYCLIENTSECRET"
      redirectURIs:
        - http://my-allowed-redirect-uri
# - ADD A 2nd OIDC CLIENT HERE
# - ADD A 3rd OIDC CLIENT HERE
```

To configure vCluster.Pro as an OIDC provider somewhere else, you can fill out the following fields with:

- OIDC Provider Endpoint / Issuer: https://vcluster-pro.mycompany.tld/oidc
- OIDC Client ID: loft
- OIDC Client Secret: MYCLIENTSECRET
- Group Claim Name: groups
- Available OIDC Scopes: offline_access,openid,groups,email,profile

With this configuration, your vCluster.Pro users will be able to authenticate in another application using their vCluster.Pro account (which may itself be based on another SSO provider).
