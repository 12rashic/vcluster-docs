While we hope you don't run into any issues while deploying vCluster.Pro, it sometimes happens! This
page contains some information that may help you resolve deployment issues. If you're still
stuck, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.loft.sh/) where you can find a #vcluster-pro channel
where you can ask other questions!

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Flag `--reset`

If you need a clean vCluster.Pro installation, you can use the `--reset` flag to tell vCluster.Pro CLI to purge
any previous vCluster.Pro installs:

```bash
vcluster pro start --reset    # --insecure  ...add any other `vcluster pro start` flags if needed
```

### Debug `ImageErr` + `ImagePullBackOff`

If your vCluster.Pro pods are not starting because the vCluster.Pro images cannot be pulled, you may need to
[use a private image registry](/platform/admin/guides/offline-installations.mdx#offline-images) rather than
pulling vCluster.Pro images from Docker Hub.

### Use Port-Forwarding

You can always try to connect to vCluster.Pro directly and circumvent any potential networking issues
introduced at the load balancer and ingress controller level.

To start port-forwarding, either use `vcluster pro start` or run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deploy/loft -n vcluster-pro 8080:10443
```

After that you can access vCluster.Pro at `https://localhost:8080`. You can even login with the vCluster.Pro CLI
to this URL with:

```bash
vcluster pro login localhost:8080 --insecure
```

If you can access vCluster.Pro via port-forwarding only, this is usually an indicator that the problem
might be related to a misconfigured LoadBalancer or Ingress Controller.
