## Key Concepts

<KeyConcepts />

## Before you begin

<PreRequisites />

## Deploy vCluster
Deploy a vCluster instance called `my-vcluster` to namespace `team-x`. In this guide, we will use vCluster CLI, but there are multiple ways to deploy vCluster using other tools like Helm, Terraform, ArgoCD, Cluster API, etc. Read about our additional options in the [deployment section of the docs](./vcluster/deploy/basics).

## Use your virtual cluster

Interacting with a virtual cluster is very similar to using a standard Kubernetes cluster.

### Connect

Connect to your virtual cluster and update your kube context to point to the virtual cluster:

```bash
vcluster connect my-vcluster --namespace team-x
```

### Deploy resources inside the virtual cluster

<DeployResources />

### View resources inside the host cluster

<ViewHostResources />

## Delete vCluster

Deleting a vCluster instance also deletes all objects within and all states related to the vCluster. If the namespace on the host cluster was created by the vCluster CLI, then that namespace is also deleted. 

```bash
vcluster delete my-vcluster --namespace team-x
```
