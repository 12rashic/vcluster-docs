3. Configure a Virtual Cluster

Create vcluster.yaml

Copy this example snippet

Tabs: CLI, Helm, kubectl, Terraform, Argo, Cluster API, â€¦

CLI: vcluster upgrade vc1 -f vcluster.yaml


## Configure your virtual cluster

You configure your virtual clusters using the vCluster configuration file called `vcluster.yaml`. 

## Config examples


### Change Node behavior

Let's take a look at how you can use the vcluster.yaml to change the behavior of how nodes are shown inside a vcluster

Using the default settings, users within the virtual cluster would only see pseudo-nodes that have different names and a made-up spec rather than the real nodes from the underlying host cluster. Let's change that. Let's see what that looks like:

`kubectl get nodes`

Create vcluster.yaml with this content:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      real:
        enabled: true
```

With the example configuration shown in this vcluster.yaml, we can enable the user inside a virtual cluster to see the real node names and the real spec of the nodes as they are in the underlying host cluster.

Now, let's apply this vcluster.yaml

Tab CLI: `vcluster update [name] -f vcluster.yaml`

After updating the virtual cluster, let's check out the nodes again:

`kubectl get nodes`
