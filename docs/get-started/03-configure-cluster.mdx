## Configure your virtual cluster

You configure your virtual clusters using the vCluster configuration file called `vcluster.yaml`. 

## Config examples

@TODO find out what examples would be most beneficial to users

### Change Node behavior

In this example, you use the `vcluster.yaml` to change the behavior of how nodes are shown inside a virtual cluster.

Using the default settings, users within the virtual cluster would only see pseudo-nodes that have different names and a made-up spec rather than the real nodes from the underlying host cluster. Let's change that. Let's see what that looks like:

`kubectl get nodes`

Create a `vcluster.yaml` file with this content:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      real:
        enabled: true
```

With the example configuration shown in this vcluster.yaml, we can enable the user inside a virtual cluster to see the real node names and the real spec of the nodes as they are in the underlying host cluster.

After updating the virtual cluster, let's check out the nodes again:

`kubectl get nodes`

See the [vcluster.yaml node section](/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes.mdx) for a detailed config reference.


### Change Kubernetes distribution

Change Kubernetes distro or update existing distro version


### Replicate a host service

@TODO show real examples, even if it's just nginx 

In this example, you map a service `my-host-service` in the namespace `my-host-namespace` to the virtual cluster service `my-virtual-service` in the virtual cluster namespace `vcluster-my-vcluster`.

```yaml
replicateServices:
  fromHost:
  - from: my-host-namespace/my-host-service
    to: vcluster-my-vcluster/my-virtual-service
```

vCluster replicates the service in the virtual cluster, with the virtual cluster service pointing to the service running in the host cluster. Pods inside the virtual cluster can access the host service using `my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace` syntax. For example, if you use cURL, the command is `curl http://my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace`.
