You configure your virtual clusters using the vCluster configuration file called `vcluster.yaml`. This guide includes some examples to illustrate what you can do. See the `vcluster.yaml` [config section](/vcluster-yaml/README.mdx) for more information.


## Change Kubernetes distribution

vCluster uses [Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)](https://k3s.io/) by default but supports most Kubernetes distributions. In this example, you enable the vanilla Kubernetes distro. When choosing this option, vCluster deploys a separate etcd cluster, Kubernetes controller manager, and Kubernetes API server alongside the vCluster hypervisor.


```yaml
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k8s:
      enabled: true
  distro:
    k3s:
      enabled: false
```

## Change Node behavior

In this example, you change the behavior of how vCluster shows nodes inside a virtual cluster.

By default, vCluster creates [fake node](/architecture/nodes.mdx) for every pod `spec.nodeName` that it encounters within the virtual cluster.

within the virtual cluster you only see [fake nodes] that have different names and a made-up spec rather than the real nodes from the underlying host cluster.

`kubectl get nodes`

To see real nodes, create a `vcluster.yaml` file with this content:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      real:
        enabled: true
```

This enables you to see the real node names and the real spec of the nodes as they are in the underlying host cluster.

After updating the virtual cluster, view the nodes again:

`kubectl get nodes`

See the [vcluster.yaml node section](/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes.mdx) for a detailed config reference.


## Replicate a host service

In this example, you map a service `my-host-service` in the namespace `my-host-namespace` to the virtual cluster service `my-virtual-service` in the virtual cluster namespace `vcluster-my-vcluster`.

```yaml
replicateServices:
  fromHost:
  - from: my-host-namespace/my-host-service
    to: vcluster-my-vcluster/my-virtual-service
```

vCluster replicates the service in the virtual cluster, with the virtual cluster service pointing to the service running in the host cluster. Pods inside the virtual cluster can access the host service using `my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace` syntax. For example, if you use cURL, the command is `curl http://my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace`.
