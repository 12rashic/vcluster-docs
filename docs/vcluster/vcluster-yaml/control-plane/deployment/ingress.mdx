import ControlPlaneIngress from '@site/docs/_partials/config/controlPlane/ingress.mdx'

Configure this when you want vCluster to deploy an Ingress resource to expose the virtual cluster's API server at a hostname. The cluster must have an ingress controller running and a LoadBalancer Service.

This feature is not the same as syncing Ingress resources between the host and virtual clusters. See [sync.fromHost.ingressClasses](/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/ingress-classes.mdx) and [sync.toHost.ingresses](/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/networking/ingresses.mdx).



- I could not find much existing documentation, however there's [Kubernetes Ingress Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)


 if `ingress.spec.rules` are not given, a default set of rules will be used. This default rule uses the `ingress.host` and `ingress.pathType` configuration, but if `ingress.spec.rules` is provided they are ignored.
