These options allow the vCluster proxy to connect to the underlying kubernetes distribution. Each distribution has its own default locations where it writes its certificates and kube configs. There should rarely be an occasion where end users need to configure these, unless the following occurs:
- Customer wants to use the no-op syncer to connect to a different kubernetes cluster, as in [ENG-1555[(https://linear.app/loft/issue/ENG-1555/vclusterpro-no-op-syncer-for-non-vcluster-use)
- a distribution changes their default location in a newer version and we have not updated our default values
- a user wishes to use an unsupported distribution that has different locations for each of these values

Previous flag mappings:
- `kubeConfig` previously `--kube-config`
- `serverCAKey` previously `--server-ca-key`
- `serverCAVert` previously `--server-ca-cert`
- `clientCACert` previously `--client-ca-cert`
- `requestHeaderCACert` previously `--request-header-ca-cert`
