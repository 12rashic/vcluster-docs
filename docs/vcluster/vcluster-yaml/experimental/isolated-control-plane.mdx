{/* 
- Original docs: https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/isolated_control_planes
- Not super clear from the original docs, but this involves deploying two `VirtualClusterInstance` when used with the platform:
  - One that hosts the control plane, where `kubectl` connects and is used to manage workloads
  - One where the workloads are scheduled (headless)
    - when headless, no control plane is deployed
- Previously a platform only feature, where the platform handles
  - creating the kube config
  - passing the required `--remote-kube-config`, `--remote-namespace`, and `--remote-service-name` options
  - adding the `volume` / `volumeMount` to make the kube config available to the syncer
- Possible to use this as a Pro feature, but the user would be responsible for providing:
  - `kubeConfig` is the path to the kubeconfig used to connect to the connected cluster
    - previously `--remote-kube-config`
    - storing the config in a secret or config map
    - mounting this secret or config map as a `volume`
    - giving a `volumeMount` to the syncer container
  - `namespace` of the remote control plane service
    - previously `--remote-namespace`
  - `service` is the name of the remote control plane service
    - previously `--remote-service-name`
  - If one were inclined, you could use a physical cluster as a workload cluster, passing `default` for `namespace` and `kubernetes` for `service`
  - may discourage non-platform users from using this?

The vCluster control plane runs in one cluster, while a second, headless vCluster instance runs workloads in a separate cluster.

## Key benefits

- **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Deploy control planes on cost-effective clusters
and direct heavy-duty tasks, such as GPU-intensive workloads, to higher-performance
clusters.

- **Simplified Management:** Offers a straightforward, enforceable, alternative
to each developer managing increasingly complex amounts of Taints/Tolerations or
node affinities to schedule workloads to the appropriate clusters.

- **Enhanced Security with Control:** Developers can manage workloads via the control
plane, even if the workloads reside in a secure zone. This eliminates the need to
provide developers with direct cluster access, firewall configurations, permissions
management, and more.

- **Divided Responsibilities:** Allows for a clear separation of duties, where one
team oversees the control plane cluster and other teams handle the workload clusters.
