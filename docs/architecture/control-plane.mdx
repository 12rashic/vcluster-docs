## Control plane elements

The control plane container has an API server, a controller manager, and a data store mount. By default, vCluster uses SQLite as a data store and runs the API server and controller manager of [Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)](https://k3s.io/), which is a certified Kubernetes distribution and CNCF sandbox project. 

You can use a different data store, such as etcd, MySQL or PostgreSQL. You are also able to use another Kubernetes distribution as a backing virtual cluster.

Each vCluster instance has its own control plane consisting of:

- **Kubernetes API** server: Point your kubectl requests to this vCluster API server.
- **Data store**: This is where the API stores all resources. Real clusters run with etcd.
- **Controller Manager**: Creates Pod objects in the data store according to replica number in each ReplicaSet.
- **(Optional) Scheduler**: Schedules workloads inside the virtual cluster. See [Pod scheduling](/architecture/scheduling.mdx) for more info.


## Kubernetes distributions

- [Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)](https://k3s.io/)

  By default, vCluster uses K3s as a virtual Kubernetes cluster. K3s is is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

  vCluster is not tied to a specific distribution and should work with all certified Kubernetes distributions. By default, Loft Labs recommends using K3s, because it has a small footprint and is widely adopted. However, if your use case requires a different Kubernetes distribution, vCluster currently  supports k0s and vanilla Kubernetes. You can also add a custom Kubernetes distribution.

- [Zero Friction Kuberntes (k0s)](https://k0sproject.io/)

  k0s is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. vCluster supports k0s as a backing virtual Kubernetes cluster.

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

  You can use vanilla Kubernetes as your virtual cluster. When choosing this option, vCluster deploys a separate etcd cluster, Kubernetes controller manager, and API server alongside the vCluster hypervisor.
