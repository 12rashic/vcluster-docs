What makes a vCluster instance virtual is that it does not have actual worker nodes or a network. Instead, vCluster has  a _Syncer_ component that copies the virtual cluster pods to the host cluster. The host cluster schedules the pod, and the Syncer keeps the virtual cluster pod and host cluster pod in sync.
