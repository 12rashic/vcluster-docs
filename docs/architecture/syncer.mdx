What makes a vCluster instance virtual is that it does not have actual worker nodes or network. 
Instead, a vCluster instance uses a _syncer_ which copies the pods that are created within the virtual cluster to the underlying host cluster.
Then, the host cluster schedules the pod and the vCluster keeps the virtual cluster pod and host cluster pod in sync.
