## Feature overview

vCluster has no dependencies on any specific Kubernetes distribution, so you should be able to run vCluster with most certified Kubernetes distributions.

vCluster requires that the distribution can be deployed without a scheduler and kubelet, meaning that vCluster requires the Kubernetes API server, controller manager, and data storage of the distribution.

For single binary distributions, such as K3s or k0s, extra bundled components can usually be disabled through flags. For multi binary distributions, such as vanilla K8s, you just need to deploy the virtual control plane with the Kubernetes API server, controller manager, and usually etcd.


vCluster only needs the following information from the virtual Kubernetes distribution to function properly:
1. The Kubernetes API server central authority certificate (usually found at `/pki/ca.crt`)
2. The Kubernetes API server central authority key (usually found at `/pki/ca.key`)
3. An admin kubeconfig to contact the virtual Kubernetes control plane (usually found at `/pki/admin.conf`)

@TODO is this still relevant? -> For multi binary distributions, vCluster can even create those with a pre-install hook as found in the [K8s chart](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/charts/k8s/templates).
