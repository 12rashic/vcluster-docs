## Feature overview

[comment]: # (It's essentially a coop config file is generated in the cluster and context defines the name of the coop context.)
[comment]: # (Server is the Kubernetes API server. And secret is the secret where this coop config is saved)

argo cd spin up or other - sharing

@TODO why would I configure this?
