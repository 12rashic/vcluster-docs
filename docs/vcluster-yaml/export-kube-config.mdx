## Feature overview

[comment]: # (It's essentially a coop config file is generated in the cluster and context defines the name of the coop context.)
[comment]: # (Server is the Kubernetes API server. And secret is the secret where this coop config is saved)

This feature exports the kubeconfig file so you can use it, for example, in your ArgoCD or Terraform pipelines.

## Config reference

@TODO remove yaml when generated is the way we want

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: ""
  server: ""
  secret:
    name: ""
    namespace: ""
```



<ExportKubeConfig />
