import SyncNodes from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/fromHost/nodes.mdx'

Sync real nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. If enabled, this implies that `fake-nodes` is disabled. See [Nodes](/architecture/nodes.mdx) for more information.

{/*
`nodes.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- exists from the beginning. I believe one would need this to schedule any pods
- may be possible to disable this in the "control plane" vCluster when using [Isolated Control Plane](https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/isolated_control_planes), where all the workloads are scheduled to the workload cluster (where nodes syncing would be enabled)

`nodes.syncBackChanges`:
- replaces deprecated flag `--sync-node-changes`
- enables syncing labels and taints from virtual cluster nodes to the host nodes
- requires adding rbac permissions to modify the host node & status

`nodes.clearImageStatus`:
- sets `--node-clear-image-status`, added with this PR: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/826
- description says it's to prevent information about the node from leaking in a multi-tenant environment

`nodes.selector.all`:
- sets `--sync-all-nodes` syncer flag, see also [Example: Sync All Nodes](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/architecture/nodes#example-sync-all-nodes)

`nodes.selector.labels`:
- selects node labels that will be synced to the vCluster. This allows controlling which nodes can be used by the vCluste
- Some example use cases:
  - only allow nodes in a region
  - only allow nodes with a particular architecture
  - only use spot instances
  - prevent vClusters from sharing resources with critical infrastructure
