{/*
`events.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- not much context around why this was added, an educated guess is to mirror pod status updates
*/}

Sync [Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) from the host cluster to the virtual cluster to be able to view things like pod events from within the virtual cluster. The synced events will be the ones associated with virtual cluster resources that have been synced to the host cluster. This enabled by default to provide visibility for vCluster users.

### Sync Events from host to virtual cluster
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    events:
      enabled: true
```
