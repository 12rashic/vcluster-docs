import EnableSwitch from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/fromHost/events/enabled.mdx'

Sync events from the host cluster to the virtual cluster to be able to view things like pod events from within the virtual cluster. The synced events will be the ones associated with virtual cluster resources that have been synced to the host cluster.

### Sync events
Syncing events is enabled by default:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    events:
      enabled: true
```

{/*
`events.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- not much context around why this was added, an educated guess is to mirror pod status updates
*/}
