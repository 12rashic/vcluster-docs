import SyncFromHost from '@site/docs/_partials/config/syncFromHost.mdx'


## Feature overview

We use the top-level `import` field in the configuration to declare which host resources we want to sync to the virtual cluster. Each item in the `import` array defines the resource via `apiVersion` and `kind` strings. Each `apiVersion` and `kind` pair can have only one entry in the `import` array. The `patches` field allows you to define how are certain fields of the synced resource modified before its creation(or update) in the virtual cluster.   
The `reversePatches` field allows you to declare how changes to certain fields of the synced resource(in this case, the one created in the virtual cluster) are propagated back to the original resource in the host cluster. Only the fields referenced in the `copyFromObject` reverse patch operations are propagated.
Both these fields follow the same syntax, as documented in [the "Patch syntax" chapter of this doc](#patch-syntax).


Example:
```yaml
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      import:
        - kind: Secret
          apiVersion: v1
        - kind: IngressClass
          apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
```

:::info
The sync from Host to Virtual cluster is supported only in ["Multi-namespace mode"](./multi_namespace_mode.mdx)
