Mirrors CSIStorageCapacity objects from the host cluster to the virtual cluster if the `.nodeTopology` matches a synced node.

Enabled automatically when the virtual scheduler is enabled. Disabling this option while using the virtual scheduler may result in incorrect pod scheduling.

{/*
`csiStorageCapacities.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- Added as part of this issue: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/773
- tl;dr: syncing these from the host helps the virtual cluster scheduler make decisions about which node to schedule pods to.
