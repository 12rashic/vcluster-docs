Mirrors Pods.

{/*
`pods.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources

`pods.translateImage`:
- This seems to have existed from the beginning, and only referenced here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/config-reference

`pods.enforceTolerations`:
- This was requested / implemented by a community member here: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/330
- tl;dr: this can be used to schedule vcluster pods to dedicated host nodes. Basically you can configure nodes with a "taint" and then make the vcluster pods "tolerate" the taint

`pods.useSecretsForSATokens`:
- Old documentation link: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/other-topics#secret-based-service-account-tokens

`pods.rewriteHosts`:
- I think this was previously the `--overide-hosts` option mentioned here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/config-reference
- This seems to have existed from the beginning
