import EnableSwitch from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/toHost/persistentVolumes/enabled.mdx'

Mirrors persistent volumes from the virtual cluster to host cluster. If enabled, implies that fake-persistentvolumes is disabled. Syncing this is not necessary in order to use PersistentVolumeClaims.

When real PV is needed: Cases that require knowledge of the PV and its IDs such Valero or specific CSI drivers

Fake has random IDs

Just using regular PVCs can use the fake PVs


See [Storage](/architecture/storage.mdx) for details on how this feature works.
