Sync storage classes from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. As long as the necessary CSI driver is installed within the host cluster, certain parameters for the CSI driver will update through a synced storage class.

See [Storage](/architecture/storage.mdx) for more information.

### Sync storage classes from virtual cluster to host cluster
```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    storageClasses:
      enabled: true
```
