Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot resource represents a snapshot of a volume on a storage system. You can read more about volume snapshots on [the official Kubernetes documentation page of this feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/).

By default, VolumeSnapshot syncing is disabled, and creating a VolumeSnapshot custom resource in the virtual cluster has no effect on the host cluster. Following chapters describe how to enable this feature in the vCluster.

See [Storage](/architecture/storage.mdx) for details on how this feature works.
