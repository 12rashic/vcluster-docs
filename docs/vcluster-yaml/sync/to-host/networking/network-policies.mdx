:::info
Network Policies in vCluster rely on the support for this feature in the host cluster. Make sure that your host cluster satisfies the [Network Policy prerequisites](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#prerequisites).
:::

Kubernetes has a [Network Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) resource type that allows the creation of the rules that govern how pods communicate with each other.

By default, vCluster ignores these resources. However, once you enable synchronization of the Network Policies, vCluster will ensure correct policies are created in the host cluster to achieve the desired traffic behaviour.

`networkPolicies.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- Added in response to issue: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/155
