import SyncToHost from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/toHost.mdx'



Use the top-level `export` field in the configuration to declare which virtual resources we want to sync to the host cluster. Each item in the `export` array defines the resource via `apiVersion` and `kind` strings. Each `apiVersion` and `kind` pair can have only one entry in the `export` array. The `patches` field allows you to define how are certain fields of the synced resource modified before its creation(or update) in the host cluster.
The `reversePatches` field allows you to declare how changes to certain fields(implicitly this is done for the `status`) of the synced resource(the one created in the host cluster) are propagated back to the original resource in the virtual cluster. Besides the status, only the fields referenced in the `copyFromObject` reverse patch operations are propagated.



Example:
```yaml
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      export:
        - apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
          kind: Certificate
          patches:
            - op: rewriteName
              path: spec.issuerRef.name
            - op: rewriteName
              path: spec.secretName
          reversePatches:
            # Implicit reverse patch for status would be declared like so:
            # - op: copyFromObject
            #   fromPath: status
            #   path: status
```

:::info
Only the namespaced resources are supported at this time.

**Selector for a generic Virtual to Host sync**
You can limit which resources will be synced from the virtual cluster by configuring the `selector` array. The virtual resource is synced when it matches one or more selectors, or when the `selector` field is empty. Supported selector types are:
`labelSelector` - the `key: value` map of the resource labels. All of the defined label key and values should match on the resource in the virtual cluster to be synced. Example:
```yaml
sync:
  generic:
    config: |-
      version: v1beta1
      export:
        - apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
          kind: Certificate
          selector:
            labelSelector:
              "label-key": "label-value"
```
