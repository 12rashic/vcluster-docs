Upgrading vCluster Platform is easy! vCluster Platform can be upgraded either via the vCluster CLI, or with Helm.

<PartialAdminUpgrade />

:::info Versions and Values
The `$VERSION` variable above is an environment variable set to your desired vCluster Platform version to
deploy. The `vcluster-platform.yaml` file is an optional YAML file that contains Helm values you would like
to use when upgrading your vCluster Platform deployment.
:::

## Upgrading from v3.x to v4.0

:::info Upgrade to latest v3 first
Before attempting to perform this major upgrade please ensure that you have upgraded to the latest v3 release first. E.g. by running the steps above.
:::

With v4.0 the project namespace prefix can now be configured and the default has been changed from `loft-p` (which is used by v3) to `p-`.
In order for the upgrade from v3 to v4 to succeed you must set this explicitly regardless of updating via the vCluster CLI or via Helm.
