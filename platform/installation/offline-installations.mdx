## Air-Gapped / Offline / VPC Clusters

If your cluster is air-gapped, within a VPC or restricts network connectivity in other ways, you
may run into issues validating the vCluster Platform license and pulling vCluster Platform images required for vCluster Platform.

To solve the licensing issue, you can either use allow HTTP requests from the vCluster Platform pod(s) to
`https://admin.loft.sh/*` (this is the preferred option), or use an
[offline license key](#offline-license-key).

To solve not being able ot pull images from Docker hub, you can
[use a private image registry](#offline-images) to host your own copies of the vCluster Platform image that
your cluster can reach.

### Prerequisites

- A running air-gapped Kubernetes cluster `v1.26.x`, `v1.27.x`, or `v1.28.x`
- On installation computer:
    - `kubectl` (check via `kubectl version`)
    - `helm` (check with `helm version`)
    - `docker` (check with `docker version`)
    - A `kube-context` with admin access to this Kubernetes cluster (check with `kubectl auth can-i create clusterrole -A`)
    - [Optional] An offline license key for vCluster.Pro (provided by Loft)
- [Optional] A private docker registry that the installer computer and the air-gapped Kubernetes cluster can access

### Resource requirements

- vCluster.Pro manager pod resource requirements:
    - Requests
        - memory: `256Mi`
        - cpu: `200m`
    - Limits
        - memory: `4Gi`
        - cpu: `2`

- Open network ports:
    > Since loft installs webhooks and api server extensions into the cluster, the kubernetes master needs to be able to communicate with the loft pods. In private GKE clusters the kubernetes master and nodes for example are not in the same subnetwork, and cannot communicate directly with each other on every port. Hence, you need to ensure that there is a firewall rule that allows incoming traffic from the kubernetes master network to the tcp ports:
    - `8443` (loft agent api service extension - `v1.cluster.loft.sh`)
    - `9443` (loft agent webhook & loft webhook)
    - `9444` (loft api service extension - `v1.management.loft.sh`)


### Offline Images

If your cluster is not able to pull images from Docker Hub, you have to push the vCluster Platform images
into your private registry. To find out which images are required, we publish a file called
`loft-images.txt` with each vCluster Platform release.

Follow these instructions to download all vCluster Platform and import them to your private registry:

<Flow id="offline-images">
    <Step>
        <PartialAdminSetVersion/>
  </Step>
  <Step>

Set your private registry as variable:

```bash
REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam      # THIS SHOULD BE A PREFIX / DO NOT INCLUDE ANY LOFT_IMAGE PATHS
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Download the file `loft-images.txt` and the required scripts called `download-images.sh` and `push-images.sh` and make them executable:

```bash
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/loft-images.txt
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/download-images.sh
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/push-images.sh

chmod +x ./download-images.sh
chmod +x ./push-images.sh
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `download-images.sh` to download all images locally:

```bash
./download-images.sh --image-list loft-images.txt
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `push-images.sh` to push all downloaded images to your private registry:

```bash
./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY}
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Edit your existing `vcluster-pro.yaml` file or create a new file named `vcluster-pro.yaml` with content:

```yaml
image: ${REGISTRY}/ghcr.io/loft-sh/loft:${VERSION} # Replace ${REGISTRY} and ${VERSION}
env:
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ${REGISTRY} # Replace ${REGISTRY}
```

  </Step>
  <Step>
        <PartialAdminUpgrade/>
    </Step>
</Flow>

### Offline License Key

If your cluster does not allow the vCluster Platform pod to connect the vCluster Platform license server
(`https://admin.loft.sh/*`), you can contact [sales@loft.sh](mailto:sales@loft.sh) to purchase
an offline license key or to request a trial license key for offline use.

You can edit vCluster Platform install values as follows to use your offline license key:

```yaml
env:
  LICENSE_KEY: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
```
