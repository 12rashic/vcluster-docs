Each project has different settings that can be configured per project.

### Members

Perhaps the most important aspect of projects is that they contain members, that is, users and teams that are a part
of the given project. Only users and teams that are part of the project (and global admins) will have access to the
project. Moreover, each user or team can be given specific roles that define their access within the
project. See the [Manage Project Members](./members) section for more information.

### Allowed Templates

Projects contain a list of allowed templates that can be used by members to create virtual
cluster instances. Admins can configure default templates, or simply allow all templates for the project.
See the [Manage Allowed Templates](./templates) section for more information.

### Allowed Clusters

Each project may define specific clusters that members of the project have access to. The member users and teams
will have their roles propagated to each allowed cluster. See the [Manage Allowed Clusters](./clusters) section for more information.

### Quotas

Each project may define a quota to limit resource consumption. By limiting how much resources can be consumed helps prevent from any instance or user to abuse the cluster resources. See the [Configure Project Quotas](./quotas) section for more information.
